For all students I have embedded the class codes in all these python programs.
To make these classes automatically, You have to follow a few steps:
1. Please install the MS Teams app.
1. Install the python(Please don't forget to run as administrator)
2. Then run command prompt as administrator.
3. Run this command ------->     pip install pyautogui
4.  Run this command ------->     pip install pynput
[Note: Please turn on internet before running these commands]
5. Now you are ready. You can close your cmd prompt.
6. Please make any Browser as a default browser 
	and tick the box which opens all the links in ms teams.
6. Open the code "3rd Slot.py" and make the changes of the class link and the timing.




[P.S.: I have made these files for educational purpose. Please don't skip the valueable classes 
       in which you can understand a particular topic in 1.5 hours which you may understand within 
       10 mins from youtube lectures.]
